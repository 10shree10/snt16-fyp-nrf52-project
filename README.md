# snt16-fyp-nrf52-project
This repo contains all the project files to build and run the software written for the nrf52832 Nordic SoC for the EEE final year project, as well as the SOLIDWORKS parts and assemblies used in the 3D model

The Keil uVision project is adapted from the SAADC peripheral example from the nRF5 SDK v16.0.0. The main.c and the sdkconfig.h files are the only two files that were modified

The project can be found in saadc_pca10040.uvprojx. This was developed using the PCA10040 development board, which has the nRF52832 SoC, and can be found \saadc\pca10040\blank\arm5_no_packs.

It is recommended that the full nRF5 SDK v16.0.0 is available from your working directory. The SDK can be downloaded from here: https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.nordic.infocenter.sdk5.v15.0.0%2Findex.html, which also contains a guide to getting started.
